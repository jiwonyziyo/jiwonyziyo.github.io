**Dark patterns** are UI/UX design techniques intentionally crafted to exploit human psychology and trick users into doing things they don’t necessarily want to do. The British UX designer **Harry Brignull**, who first coined the term, described dark patterns as follows

> *“A carefully crafted user interface designed to trick users into performing actions such as signing up for insurance or signing up for recurring bills.”*

In other words, dark patterns refer to UI/UX that is cleverly and intentionally designed to elicit certain actions from users, whether they want to or not. These designs often serve business goals, such as increasing subscriptions or data collection, but they do so at the expense of the user’s autonomy, leading to unintended actions like accidental purchases or subscriptions.

### Types of Dark Patterns Design

Here are five types of dark patterns commonly seen

1. **Nagging**

</div>

- **Nagging** occurs when an app or website repeatedly interrupts the user’s progress with prompts or messages, draining their time and attention. These interruptions can make the user feel pressured or annoyed, leading them to eventually agree to the message or request—even if it’s not what they want—just to move forward.
- If the interruptions happen frequently, the user might decide that giving in to the prompt is easier than continuing to dismiss it. This pattern is commonly seen in requests to subscribe to premium services, allow notifications, or share personal data, and it can result in a frustrating user experience.

2. **Obstruction**

</div>

- **Obstruction** involves intentionally making certain tasks difficult or confusing for the user. It artificially complicates the steps required to perform actions that the user might want to avoid, such as canceling a service, deleting an account, or disabling ads. Designers create complex menu structures, lengthy procedures, and multiple confirmation steps to increase the likelihood that the user will give up.
- For example, subscribing to a service may be as simple as one click, but canceling that same service might involve navigating through a series of confusing steps, or even contacting customer support. By increasing the effort required to complete the task, users are more likely to give up and continue their subscription, even if they originally intended to cancel.

3. **Sneaking**

</div>

- **Sneaking** occurs when important information, such as additional fees or terms, is hidden from the user until the last possible moment. This pattern is often used to make a product or service appear cheaper or more attractive than it actually is, only revealing the true cost or consequences just before the user commits.

- For example, an e-commerce site may show an item at a discounted price, but hidden fees like taxes or shipping costs are only added at the checkout stage. This tactic leaves the user feeling deceived and frustrated because they weren’t provided with full transparency from the beginning.


4. **Interface Interference**

</div>

- **Interface** interference manipulates the design of user interface elements—such as buttons, links, or menus—to confuse or mislead the user. This could involve making certain options (like opting out or declining a service) difficult to see or access, or intentionally placing desired actions in locations where users are less likely to find them.

- A common example is when a “Subscribe” or “Accept” button is highlighted in bright colors, while the “No Thanks” or “Decline” option is either hidden or made to blend in with the background. This visual manipulation influences the user’s decision, making them more likely to choose the option that benefits the company.

5. **Forced Action**

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

- **Forced Action** refers to situations where the user is required to perform a specific action in order to continue using a service or complete a task. This pattern typically forces users to agree to terms, share personal information, or sign up for a service they may not want, simply to proceed with what they were doing.

- For instance, a user might be required to create an account or subscribe to a newsletter before they can continue using a free app or access content. This design forces users to take an action they don’t necessarily want to take, making them feel trapped or cornered.
