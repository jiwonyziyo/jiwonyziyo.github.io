# HCI Researcher : [Young-Ho Kim](http://younghokim.net/)

## Current Role and Expertise

**Young-Ho Kim** is a **Lead Research Scientist at NAVER AI Lab** and a prominent researcher in the field of **HCI**. His work spans across multiple domains, including **Personal Health Informatics**, **Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp)**, and **Personal Data Visualization**. By integrating his knowledge of **computer science** and **visual communication design**, Kim focuses on designing systems that enhance human-data interaction, especially in the context of **self-tracking technologies**.

## Research Focus

His **current research** emphasizes the development of **flexible self-tracking systems** that adapt to the needs, contexts, and preferences of individuals. His goal is to empower users to make informed decisions and behavioral changes through better data interaction. His approach often involves combining **AI** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** technologies, particularly **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, to create **intelligent self-trackers**. These systems help users better understand and reflect on their behaviors and health data in everyday contexts.

## Recent Research Projects

- **CareCall**: A project designed to use LLMs for public health interventions. In this system, conversational AI assists socially isolated individuals by conducting regular check-up calls. The system not only gathers health metrics but also provides emotional support through empathetic conversations. The findings from this project highlight both the benefits and challenges of using LLM-driven systems in real-world public health contexts, such as balancing user expectations and handling the limitations of AI in personalization and memory. 

- **Textoshop**: A novel tool that applies concepts from image editing to text manipulation. It allows users to engage in flexible and creative text editing by treating words and sentences similarly to how designers manipulate visual elements in software like Photoshop.



## Notable Contributions and Impact on HCI

Kim's work has significantly impacted how **AI and human-centered design** are integrated into real-world applications. By designing systems that bridge the gap between humans and data, he has contributed to making **self-tracking technologies** more accessible and adaptable to various user needs. His contributions to **public health technology**—especially in using AI to enhance social and emotional well-being—highlight the evolving role of **HCI** in addressing both technical and social challenges.
