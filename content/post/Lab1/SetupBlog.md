Today, I'll show you how to set up a blog using Hugo and deploy it on GitHub Pages. I'll be working on a MacBook ðŸ’» (Apple silicon).

## Why Hugo?

- **No server-side code**: Hugo builds purely static files, so there is no need to manage any backend infrastructure.
- **Fast to render**: Static sites are quick to render because they are pre-built into HTML before deployment.
- **No dynamic content**: While this means no interactive elements like forms or real-time data updates, it also simplifies maintenance.
- **No database**: Content is stored as files, not in a database, which reduces complexity and overhead.
- **Often more secure**: Fewer security vulnerabilities as there are no databases or server-side scripts to attack.
- **No real-time UI**: Hugo sites donâ€™t support real-time updates or interactions without additional tools.
- **Content is versioned**: With git, all content can be version controlled, providing an easy way to manage changes and rollbacks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have **Homebrew** and Git installed on your MacBook. If you don't have it, you can install it with the command below:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

To check if Git is already installed, run the following command:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

Once installed, verify it by running `git --version` again to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Step 1: Install Hugo

To install Hugo, first you open the terminal and run this code 

```bash
brew install hugo
```

Once the installation is complete, verify the installation by checking the Hugo version

```bash
hugo version

#and if installed correctly, you should see an output similar to the following
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.74.3/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
```

---

## Step 2: Create a New Hugo Site

Now that Hugo is installed, you can create your new blog. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to store your blog and create a new site with the command below:

```bash
hugo new site <nameOftheSite>
```

Replace `nameOftheSite` with your desired name for the blog site.

---

## Step 3: Add a Theme

To give your blog a proper design, you'll need to add a theme. Hugo has a variety of themes available that you can browse and choose from.

1. Go to the [Hugo Themes website](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to browse available themes.
2. Once you find a theme you like, click on it.
3. On the theme's page, there will be a "Download" button. When you click this button, you'll be redirected to the theme's GitHub repository.
4. You should check the `ReadMe` file on the GitHub repository for instructions on how to apply the theme.

*For example, I used the `hugo-theme-stack` theme.*

First, initialize git in your project directory (ensure you are in the correct directory):

```bash
git init
```

Then, add the theme as a git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack
```

Now, open the `hugo.toml` file and configure Hugo to use this theme by adding the following line:

```toml
theme = "hugo-theme-stack"
```

Each theme has different configuration options, so make sure to follow the specific instructions in the theme's GitHub repository. You can also customize it further based on your needs.

### Step 3.1: Creating New Posts

To create a new blog post, you can use the following Hugo command:

```bash
hugo new posts/<post-name>.md
```

This will create a new Markdown file in the `content/posts/` directory. You can then edit this file to write your post.

For example:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
---

## Step 4: Create a New GitHub Repository

To deploy the site to GitHub Pages, you'll need to connect it to a GitHub repository.

First, create a new repository on your GitHub account.
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/newrepo.jpg" alt="new_repository" width="70%">
</div>

*In my case, I created my repository with the name `<username>.github.io` and left it public.*

Once the repository is created, you'll see a setup page. Here, you'll find instructions on how to push your existing files to this repository.
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/quicksetup.png" alt="new_repository" width="70%">
</div>

Go back to your terminal and connect your Hugo project to this GitHub repository by following the commands on the setup page (red box).

---

## Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages

We'll use GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the Hugo site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

I followed the steps indicated in the official Hugo documentation: [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).

Before you deploy it, you should change the `baseURL` in the `hugo.toml` file to your GitHub Pages URL.

For example, 

```toml
baseURL = "https://jiwonyziyo.github.io/"
```

---

## Step 6: Access Your Site

Once the GitHub Action finishes running, your blog will be deployed to GitHub Pages. You can check your blog by visiting the URL found in **Settings > Pages**.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/githuburl.jpg" alt="github_url" width="70%">
</div>

To see the deployment status, you can also go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository. If everything went well, you'll see that your site was successfully deployed.

## VoilÃ  ! Now you have a fully functioning personal blog!
