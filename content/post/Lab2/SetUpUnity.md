Today, I'll show you the process of setting up Unity on a MacBook ðŸ’».

## Step 1: Sign Up for a Unity Account

To start using Unity, you'll need to create an account. You can sign up on the [Unity website](https://id.unity.com/account/new).

Once your account is created, you will have access to Unity Hub.

## Step 2: Verify Student Status for Unity Education License

Unity offers free premium access to students through the Unity Student Plan. Follow these steps to verify your student status:

1. Go to the [Unity Student Plan page](https://store.unity.com/academic/unity-student).
2. Click on **Free Access: Post-Secondary**.
3. Log in with the Unity account you created earlier. (*I used my personal Google account for registration but verified my student status using my school email.*) During the verification process, you will need to provide your school information and expected graduation year.
4. After verification, you will receive a completion email. Click on **Redeem my Student plan** to finalize the process. Make sure to log in using the same email you used to sign up, not your school email.

5. You will receive a license key via email, which you will use during the Unity installation process.

## Step 3: Install Unity Hub

Unity Hub is a central application for managing Unity installations, projects, and licenses. Here's how to install Unity Hub on your MacBook:

1. Visit the [Unity Hub download page](https://unity.com/download).
2. Download and install Unity Hub for macOS.
3. Once installed, open Unity Hub and log in with your Unity account.
4. Now you need to add a license. Click on **Preferences** in Unity Hub.
   
   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="/images/unitypreferences.png" alt="preferences" width="50%">
   </div>

5. In the menu on the left, go to **Licenses** and click **Add**. Select **Activate with serial number**, then enter the license key you received via email.
   
   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="/images/unityadd.png" alt="Add" width="50%">
   </div>

6. Your license, which grants one year of access to Unity, will now be active.

   </div>

## Step 4: Install a Specific Version of Unity

For my HCI classes, I need to use a specific version of Unity rather than the latest one. Hereâ€™s how you can install a different version:

1. Open Unity Hub.
2. Go to the **Installs** tab.
   
   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="/images/unityinstall.png" alt="Install tab" width="30%">
   </div>

3. Click on **Install Editor** to install a new Unity Editor version.
4. In the **Choose a version** section, select **Archive** from the dropdown to see older versions of Unity.
   
   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="/images/unityversion.png" alt="Version" width="50%">
   </div>

5. Select the required version for your class or project.
6. Choose the **platform modules** you need (such as iOS, Android, WebGL, etc.).
7. Click **Next**, and Unity will begin installing the selected version.

## Step 5: Set Up Your First Unity Project

Once Unity is installed, you can create your first project:

1. Open Unity Hub and go to the **Projects** tab. Click **New Project**.
   
   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="/images/unitynewproject.png" alt="new_project" width="50%">
   </div>

2. Select a template (e.g., 2D, 3D, etc.) based on the type of project you want to build. Name your project and choose a location for it.
   
   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="/images/unitynewsetup.png" alt="new_project" width="50%">
   </div>

3. Click **Create**.

Unity will set up the project, and you'll be taken to the Unity Editor where you can start developing.
