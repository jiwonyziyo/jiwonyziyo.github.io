### VR, AR, and MR

- **VR (Virtual Reality):** VR immerses users in a completely virtual environment, isolating them from the real world. Users experience a 100% simulated environment. (e.g. VR museum)

- **AR (Augmented Reality):** AR overlays digital information onto the real world. Users see information or graphics layered onto their actual surroundings. (e.g. Pokémon GO)

- **MR (Mixed Reality):** Like AR, MR is based on the real world, but it allows digital objects to interact with physical surroundings. For example, a virtual character might sit on a real desk, blending naturally into the environment.
