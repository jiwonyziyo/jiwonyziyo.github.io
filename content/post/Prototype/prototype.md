## Prototype

How you can apply the same thing this kind of prototype

Heuristic evaluation - this should be done by experting fields by experts 
lab experiment/ Field study/ Survey -> are we missing any other research methods? in physics the "똘뜨스?" 

create some kind of hypothesis / it should be testable -> how bad or how good it is. importany to know about is variable. 

difference bewtween two variables woth some examples ? 

독립변수, 종속변수 

for example, imagine we work for gain the money. 
in this case the independent variable is the amount of work because this variable can change ourselves. 
the dependent variable is the salary. because the amount of the money we can earn is depends on the amount of work. 


independent variable -> 
dependent variable -> 
control variable -> which affects the dependent variables 

control variable -> ex. I drop a ball from certain height, i measure the bouncing height. (bouncing height -> dependent variable / certain  height -> indepent variable / ball(itself) or the floor -> control variable. )
