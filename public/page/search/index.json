[{"content":"Image Source: Anant Kadiyala Affordance gives users a visual hint on what actions they can take.\nFor example, when we see a button, we instinctively want to press it, or when we see a switch, we feel like pulling it. On an app or website, a rectangular box with a border makes us think we can click and type into it. These cues play into human psychology.\nThus, affordance is a crucial element of visual user interfaces. The clearer the visual cues are, the less ambiguity there is for the user to understand what action is expected.\nIn mobile environments, the importance of affordance becomes even more pronounced, as the small screen size and limited space make it harder for affordance to be as visually obvious. Therefore, clear affordance is critical to ensure smooth user interaction on mobile devices.\nGood case - Traffic lights that show the remaining time Image Source: Busan News\n1. Clear Information Display\nTraffic lights that show the remaining time provide users with clear information on how much time is left before the signal changes. Pedestrians can easily determine whether they have enough time to cross the street, and drivers can predict when the signal will switch. This intuitive display helps users make more informed and safer decisions. 2. Behavior Guidance\nThe countdown timer allows both pedestrians and drivers to act accordingly. Pedestrians can choose to cross quickly if there is enough time, or wait for the next signal if time is running out. This guides user behavior and enhances traffic safety by reducing risky actions. 3. Meeting User Expectations\nIn addition to simply showing red or green lights, the countdown timer allows users to predict signal changes more accurately. This design meets user expectations by providing precise information, reducing stress at intersections, and improving overall traffic flow. Bad case - Keyboard Image Source: https://www.clien.net/service/board/park/16744923\nThe placement of a power button above the delete key on a keyboard is a bad example of affordance.\n1. Risk of Accidental Use\nWhen the power button is located too close to the delete key, users are more likely to press it accidentally, potentially shutting down the system unintentionally. The functions are too distinct to be placed so closely. 2. Functional Mismatch\nThe delete key is frequently used, whereas the power button is not. Placing such an important function near a less frequently used key increases the risk of errors and reduces the overall usability. 3. Contrary to User Expectations\nUsers do not expect two very different functions to be positioned so closely together. This placement disrupts the intuitive understanding of how the keyboard should work. Solutions 1. Relocate the Power Button\nThe most straightforward solution is to move the power button to a location further away from frequently used keys like the delete key. For example, the power button could be placed at the right-top corner of the keyboard, near the function keys or in a separate, more isolated area where it’s less likely to be pressed by accident. 2. Add a Confirmation Step\nImplementing a confirmation step when the power button is pressed would prevent accidental shutdowns. For instance, instead of instantly shutting down the system, the button could trigger a prompt asking the user to confirm the action.

Generally, we compare visual patterns and past experiences to make sense of what we see. We often perceive these elements as a single whole, rather than as separate parts. By connecting the elements, recognizing familiar shapes, sharing information, and filling in the gaps, we make sense of the overall picture.\n1. Law of Proximity Image Source: By Cameron Chapman\nThe Law of Proximity descrives the phenomenon in which element that are close to each other are perceived and felt as a group.\nFor example, in the left image, the dots don\u0026rsquo;t appear to be grouped. However, in the right image, the dots are closer together making them appear as three distinct groups. This proximity can help in organizing related content by placing them close to each other.\n2. Law of Similarity Image Source: By Cameron Chapman\nThe Law of Similarity means that objects with similar shpes, sizes, colors, or other attributes are perceived as part of the same group.\nIn this example, all shapes are squares, but the difference in color causes our brain to group the green squares together and the gray squares together, even though they share the same shape. This shows how color similarity plays a key role in organizing visual elements into groups.\n3. Law of Closure Image Source: By Cameron Chapman\nThe Law of Closure refers to the tendency to perceive incomplete shapes as whole or complete. Our brain fills in the missing parts, allowing us to recognize an entire form even when elements are missing.\nIn the image, some parts of the shapes are missing, but our brain automatically fills in the gaps, making us perceive the incomplete shapes as a complete form. This principle is commonly seen in logos or icons where parts of the design are missing, yet we still recognize the full shape.\n4. Law of Figure-Ground Image Source: By Cameron Chapman\nThe Law of Figure-Ground describes how we distinguish an object (the figure) from its surrounding background (the ground). Our focus shifts between the object and the background, depending on what we are focusing on at any given moment.\nIn this image, depending on where we focus, we may see either the foreground shapes as the figure or the background. This principle is often used in visual illusions, where the brain toggles between seeing two different images depending on whether it focuses on the figure or the ground.\n5. Law of Continuity Image Source: By Cameron Chapman\nThe Law of Continuity states that elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived as related or continuous. This principle explains how our eyes follow the smoothest path when interpreting visual elements.\nIn this image, the red and gray dots form continuous curves. Even though they are separate dots, our brain perceives the curves as a single continuous path, demonstrating how continuity helps us organize visual elements in a flowing pattern.\n6. Law of Common-region Image Source: Uxcel\nThe Law of Common-region states that elements located within the same boundary are perceived as part of a group. A visual boundary such as a box or a color background can create this perception of grouping, even if the elements are not physically close.\nIn this image, the circles inside the box are perceived as a group because they share a common region (the box). Even though the circles outside the box are the same size, shape, and color, they are seen as separate because they are not within the same boundary.\nApplications of Gestalt laws in daily life 1. Confusing stairs Image Source: Bright Side\nProblem Law of Continuity\nThis pattern has consistent stripes, which causes our eyes to fail in distinguishing where the stairs end and begin, making the surface appear like a continuous plane. In situations where step differences need to be recognized, this pattern can create visual confusion, which poses a safety risk. Law of Figure-Ground\nThere is a lack of clear distinction between the figure (the stairs) and the background. As a result, it becomes harder to perceive the shape and depth of the stairs, and users may struggle to identify the height changes of the steps. Solution Clear Boundary Markings\nAdding a different colored stripe to the edges of each step can help clearly distinguish the boundary of the stairs. This will break the continuity and allow the steps to be seen as distinct units. Enhancing Contrast\nTo better separate the background and foreground, stronger color contrast can be applied to the steps. For example, using a brighter color on the edges of the stairs will help clearly define the steps, making it easier to perceive the changes in height. 2. Apple Recent call Problem Law of Proximity\nIn this interface, the name and the call action are perceived as a single unit or function because of how the interaction works (tapping on the name directly initiates a call.) Users expect tapping on the name to display contact details, but because the call action is implicitly tied to this tap, they accidentally initiate calls. The proximity of the name and the action (or the lack of distinction between the two actions) leads to confusion. Solution Add a confirmation dialog\nAfter tapping a contact name, ask the user, \u0026ldquo;Do you want to make a call?\u0026rdquo; This would help prevent accidental calls. Improve visual cues\nClearly distinguish the action of viewing contact details from initiating a call. For example, a separate button for calling that’s visually distinct from the contact\u0026rsquo;s name would better guide the user’s actions.

The British UX designer Harry Brignull, who first coined the term, described dark patterns as follows\n“A carefully crafted user interface designed to trick users into performing actions such as signing up for insurance or signing up for recurring bills.”\nIn other words, dark patterns refer to UI/UX that is cleverly and intentionally designed to elicit certain actions from users, whether they want to or not. These designs often serve business goals, such as increasing subscriptions or data collection, but they do so at the expense of the user’s autonomy, leading to unintended actions like accidental purchases or subscriptions.\nTypes of Dark Patterns Design Here are five types of dark patterns commonly seen\nNagging Nagging occurs when an app or website repeatedly interrupts the user’s progress with prompts or messages, draining their time and attention. These interruptions can make the user feel pressured or annoyed, leading them to eventually agree to the message or request—even if it’s not what they want—just to move forward. If the interruptions happen frequently, the user might decide that giving in to the prompt is easier than continuing to dismiss it. This pattern is commonly seen in requests to subscribe to premium services, allow notifications, or share personal data, and it can result in a frustrating user experience. Obstruction Obstruction involves intentionally making certain tasks difficult or confusing for the user. It artificially complicates the steps required to perform actions that the user might want to avoid, such as canceling a service, deleting an account, or disabling ads. Designers create complex menu structures, lengthy procedures, and multiple confirmation steps to increase the likelihood that the user will give up. For example, subscribing to a service may be as simple as one click, but canceling that same service might involve navigating through a series of confusing steps, or even contacting customer support. By increasing the effort required to complete the task, users are more likely to give up and continue their subscription, even if they originally intended to cancel. Sneaking: Hiding information, costs, or other important details from users, only to reveal them at the last moment.\nInterface Interference: Manipulating user interface elements, such as buttons or menus, to trick users into taking unintended actions.\nForced Action: Forcing users to perform specific actions (e.g., sharing personal data or subscribing to a service) in order to complete a desired task.\n","date":"2024-09-19T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/images/darkpatterndesign.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/dark-design-patterns/darkdesignpattern/","title":"Lecture 3 - Dark Design Patterns"}]
