On an app or website, a rectangular box with a border makes us think we can click and type into it. These cues play into human psychology.\nThus, affordance is a crucial element of visual user interfaces. The clearer the visual cues are, the less ambiguity there is for the user to understand what action is expected.\nIn mobile environments, the importance of affordance becomes even more pronounced, as the small screen size and limited space make it harder for affordance to be as visually obvious. Therefore, clear affordance is critical to ensure smooth user interaction on mobile devices.\nBad case The placement of a power button above the delete key on a keyboard is a bad example of affordance.\nRisk of Accidental Use: When the power button is located too close to the delete key, users are more likely to press it accidentally, potentially shutting down the system unintentionally. The functions are too distinct to be placed so closely. Functional Mismatch: The delete key is frequently used, whereas the power button is not. Placing such an important function near a less frequently used key increases the risk of errors and reduces the overall usability. Contrary to User Expectations: Users do not expect two very different functions to be positioned so closely together. This placement disrupts the intuitive understanding of how the keyboard should work.
